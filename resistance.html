    <h2>Dutch Resistance</h2>
    <h3>During the Second World War, the Netherlands was occupied pretty early on. Some people were too scared to resist, some even helped the Nazis. But a group of people formed a resistance. They sabotaged, assassinated Nazis and Dutch traitors, and spread illegal newspapers. <strong>One of them was Freddie Oversteegen, with her sister Truus.</strong></h3>
